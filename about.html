    <p>I’m a graduate student at the University of Calgary in Electrical & Software Engineering, specializing in Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, and Robotics. I also have industry experience as a Senior Field Engineer at SLB, where I worked on Artificial Lift and energy optimization projects across Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

    <p>I’m passionate about applying ML to energy systems, anomaly detection, and sustainable engineering. Beyond academics and work, I mentor engineering students, volunteer in community programs, and write about practical AI adoption in everyday workflows.</p>
